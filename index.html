    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: September 2025</p>

    <p>VaCart ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Android application ("the App") handles user data.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>VaCart does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. The app only fetches publicly available train vacancy information from the Indian Railway APIs.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any user data to third parties. All data displayed in the app comes directly from external railway APIs.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app may use third-party APIs (e.g., Indian Railway API) to fetch live train vacancy data. These services may have their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Since no personal data is collected, there is no risk of personal data misuse. All communications with APIs are handled securely.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. Since no personal information is collected, the app is safe for all age groups.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
